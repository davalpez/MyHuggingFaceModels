# Fine-Tuning Transformers with Hugging Face

Welcome to my second ML/Deep Learning project repository! This is a showcase for my experiments with the Hugging Face ecosystem.

The difference between this repository and MyKaggle repository is that for these notebooks, I plan to refer only to HuggingFace datasets and when using some more powerfull models, I will be using google collab as their T4
surpass greatly the performance I have with my local machine. For this case, you won't find a requirements.txt yet !

üìÇ **What's in This Repository?** <br>

For now, only one featured project is available. Soon, some other fine-tuned models for real-life application will be uploaded too.
   
üèÜ **Featured Projects** <br>

*   **Star-Rating Sentiment Classifier**: A multi-class classification model fine-tuned on customer reviews to predict star ratings (1-5).


üìà **Goals of This Repository** <br>

*   To document and share my process for fine-tuning and evaluating transformer models.
*   To build a portfolio of practical, real-world NLP solutions.
*   To create a resource for others looking to get started with the Hugging Face ecosystem.

üõ† **Tools & Technologies** <br>

*   **Python**: The primary programming language.
*   **Hugging Face**: `transformers`, `datasets`, `tokenizers`, and `evaluate`.
*   **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks for training the models.
*   **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy**: Essential tools for data manipulation and evaluation.
*   **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization and interpreting results.
*   **VS Code/Google Colab**: IDE/Software for coding the examples in this repository.
